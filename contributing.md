# How to contribute to the Copa Docker Desktop Extension

Before proceeding, ensure that Docker Desktop is installed on your computer and using the WSL backend if using Windows.

## Building the copa-extenion image
By default, the extension will pull the copa image from `ghcr.io/project-copacetic/copa-extension` and use that for the patching operation. If you would like to make modifications to this image and test locally, you need to build the `copa-extension` image image specified in the `/container/copa-extension` folder.

Run the following make command in the root directory to install it:

```
make build-copa-image
```
After the command finishes, confirm that the image `copa-extension` is listed when you run the command `docker images`. Once confirmed, change the `IMAGE_NAME` variable in `app.tsx` to point to  `copa-extension` instead of `ghcr.io/project-copacetic/copa-extension`.

## Building the frontend image

Change back to the root directory of the repository and run the following two commands:

```
make build-extension
```
```
make install-extension
```
After following the steps, the extension should be successfully installed in Docker Desktop. If you make any changes to the code, run `make update-extension` to see those changes reflected. 

## Install node packages locally (optional)

To use Visual Studio Code IntelliSense features (code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists), you need to install the node and yarn packages locally.

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), change to the `/ui` directory and run the following command:

```
npm install
```
If making changes to the testing code in `/e2e`, run `npm install --global yarn` to install the yarn package manager and then run the following command in the `/e2e` directory:
```
yarn install
```
